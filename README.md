Part II Research Project

Cluster contains the code and scripts run on the HPC
Data contains files generated during data analysis e.g., MLEs
Figure Production contains the code needed to recreate all the figures and diagrams present in my write up
src contains custom functions that I refer to; anyone interested in reproducing my ABC implementation or epidemic models should look here
Cluster_workflow_Notebooks contain the code that carried out analysis without figure production i.e. sampling from my parameter distributions and running simulations
Developmental contains all the other code and graphs produced during my research that didn't directly contribute to the material seen in my write up.
