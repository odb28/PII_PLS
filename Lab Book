## Tuesday 10/10/23
Today was my first day in the lab. I had previously developed a SIR model, based on Gillespe's direct method. I had included births and deaths at the same rate, however due to time
constraints it was decided to set mu=0. I developed a few tests for the model (based on P of extinctions and final epidemic sizes) which the model passed. These looked to see whether
the model roughly met the deterministic outcomes for a range of parameters. The model passed all the tests. Seed used was 1690. Librairies used include numpy, Pymc, Arviz and pyplot. Numpy had to
be rolled back to 1.5.2 in order to allow PyMC to function, as I ran into issues with that library.

I started the day continuing from Tuesday. My ambition at the start of the day was to get a few ABC models set up and running. The first task was to restructure the SIR model to return
the times as well as X in one numpy array, so that I could give the model one piece of obversed data.
